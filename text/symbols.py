from text import cmudict

_pad        = '_'
_eos        = '~'
_characters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!\'(),-.:;? '

# Prepend "@" to IPA symbols to ensure uniqueness (some are the same as English characters):
ipa = ['@' + s for s in cmudict.valid_symbols]

# Export all symbols:
symbols = [_pad, _eos] + list(_characters) + ipa
